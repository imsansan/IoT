I spend more time on Python coding this week. I finished five easy tasks and four medium tasks on Leetcode.
Also, I reviewed Lesson 2 and found some interesting projects based on Rasberry Pi on GitHub. 
This week I got an interview for F1 visa in Cambodia. And I passed. Hope I can be in the classroom soon.

Week 3 Report (Sept 13 - 19)
This week, I installed OS on my Raspberry Pi 4B.
Also some basic packages like Python3, JupyterNotebook, and Pytorch.
And replace mirror source with Tsinghua open mirror source.
The biggest problem for me is shell commands. I have idea about what to do next but I don't know the code.
Maybe, in the future, I should spend more time learning shell commands.
