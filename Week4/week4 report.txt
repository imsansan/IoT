Week 4 Report (Sept 20 - 26)

I spend more time on Python coding this week. I finished five easy tasks and four medium tasks on Leetcode.
Also, I reviewed Lesson 2 and found some interesting projects based on Rasberry Pi on GitHub. 

This week I got an interview for F1 visa in Cambodia. And I passed. Hope I can be in the classroom soon.
