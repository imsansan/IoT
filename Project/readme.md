[2020-11-28]I received Sense HAT and begin to test it.

There is a problem that the temperature is always 10Â°C higher than environment temprature. At first I think it is a quality issue. After I tried several times and did research online. The reason temperature is much higher is that Sense HAT is too close to CPU. Some people tried to offset the temperature but I think it is not accurate enough. I will try a less compatible, more accurate way. I ordered ribbon cable to seprate Sense HAT from Raspberry PI.

[2020-12-1]Because of black friday, the delivery has a delay. So I decided to finish e-mail alert first.
