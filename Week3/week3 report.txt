Week 3 Report (Sept 13 - 19)

This week i installed OS on my Raspberry Pi 4B.
Also some basic package like Python3, JupyterNotebook, Pytorch.
And replace mirror source with Tsinghua open mirror source.

The biggest problem for me is DOS command. I have idea about what to do next but i don't know the code.
Maybe in the future i should spend more time learning DOS command.
